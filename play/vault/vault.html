			Dropbox, Facebook, Google, and others store your private data on their proprietary servers,
			allowing them to read, sell, and give it to the government without your consent or knowledge.
			This app experiments with a different, serverless, approach.
			Your private data is encrypted with an AES cipher, an algorithm capable of securing NSA classified information.
			Then it is replicated to every browser currently viewing this page, which act as redundant data stores.
			This creates a fully peer to peer, decentralized data network, of which your browser is participating in right now.

					To get started, create a public and private key for your data.<br/>
					This will allow you to unlock any current data and encrypt new data.
					</span>
					<small class="help help-name hide">
					First, you need to create a public username. But warning, since this site never stores any data,
					it has no way of knowing whether this username already exists. Meaning it is best for your username
					to be as unique as possible.
					Ex. "The Kitten Ambassador", "Pheonix Revolutionary"
					</small>
					<small class="help help-pass hide">
					Second, you need to create a passphrase which will be used to encrypt your data.
					<i>It will never be exposed or transmitted over the web.</i>
					Remember, this is the master key to unlock your data, so make sure only you can guess it.
					Ex. "The rain in spain falls mostly on the llama.", "Do or do not, but always be hot."

Click here and replace this with your secret message. Then hit save.
When you reload this page and activate your encryption authorization, your secret message should reappear - even on another browser or computer.
If it does not, then there may not currently or previously have been enough data stores online. The more the merrier.
Every person viewing this site acts as a persistent store for your encrypted data, so you have an incentive to share and tweet out this website.
Each person that comes online might have a copy of your encrypted data, and it will be updated here in place.

			<b>How To:</b> If no other 'stores' are online, open this page up in a separate window (or browser) and then type in a pseudonym and pass phrase.
			Hit activate and then type in some secret message, click save. Then to test if it worked, refresh the page and login - your message should reappear!
			Next, close your other browser, refresh and login - your message can't load if there are no other stores available,
			or if the current stores are different from the ones that your data was saved to originally. Happy Encrypting!
			<b>Future:</b> Evolve into codename Kraken, which will be an open source tool that anybody can deploy to a server
			to provide realtime message relays between encrypted clients. It will automatically pair up with other servers into a redundant mesh net,
			and client editors will handle conflicts and merges. Interested? Message <a href="mailto:mark@accelsor.com">me</a>!
